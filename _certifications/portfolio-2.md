Built Machine Learning models with NumPy & scikit-learn, built & trained supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)
Built & trained a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, built & utilized decision trees & tree ensemble methods
Applied best practices for ML development & used unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection
Built recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & built a deep reinforcement learning model.
