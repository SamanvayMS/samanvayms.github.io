Welcome to my personal website! I am a Graduate Student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology and data-driven techniques to extract alpha in the markets. With a strong foundation in Quantitative Finance, Generative AI, Machine Learning, Game Theory, and Reinforcement Learning, I thrive on creating innovative trading algorithms and strategies. My goal is to deploy these strategies in real-world scenarios to achieve significant results and push the boundaries of quantitative finance.

## My Interests

### Quantitative Finance and Algorithmic Trading

Quantitative finance is my playground. I am dedicated to exploring new approaches to algorithmic trading and continually seek to expand my knowledge in this evolving field. My aim is to push the boundaries of quantitative finance by developing innovative strategies that can adapt to changing market conditions and deliver consistent returns.

### Generative AI and Machine Learning

My journey in the world of AI and Machine Learning has been driven by a fascination with how these technologies can revolutionize various domains, particularly finance. I am constantly exploring new models and techniques to enhance Information Extraction, Sentiment Analysis, and Predictive Modeling in the financial domain.
I'm also interested in Sequence-to-Sequence models such as LSTMs, Transformers for enhancing Derivative Pricing, Risk Management, and Portfolio Optimization.

### Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning

Understanding the strategic interactions in competitive environments has always intrigued me. Game Theory provides a robust framework for understanding these interactions and designing mechanisms for optimal decision-making. Reinforcement Learning, on the other hand, offers a powerful tool for developing these optimal strategies in dynamic environments. I'm passionate about combining these two fields to create cutting-edge trading algorithms that can adapt to changing market conditions and outperform traditional strategies.

### Derivatives Trading and Risk Management

Derivatives are a powerful tool for managing risk and enhancing returns. With close to 4+ years of experience in trading options and futures, and I am passionate about developing advanced strategies that leverage derivatives to optimize risk-return profiles. My goal is to combine the aforementioned areas of interest to create cutting-edge derivative trading strategies.

## My Approach

My approach is rooted in rigorous research, data-driven analysis, and continuous learning. I believe that a deep understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms is essential and must be rooted in a solid foundation of theory and practice.
