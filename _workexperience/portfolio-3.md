- Developed an advanced automated system leveraging the **OpenAI API, LangChain, and FAISS/Chroma DB** for interpreting mortgage guidelines. This system rapidly validates loans against **Verus** and **Saluda Grade** guidelines using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, enhancing the speed and accuracy of mortgage processing.
- Constructed sophisticated chained prompt pipelines designed to parse PDFs, ensuring meticulous data cleanup and preservation of critical information. This setup also facilitates the creation of a vector store, enabling the chatbot to efficiently retrieve and utilize data.
- Engineered specialized task-specific Q&A chains and refined query processing using a **recursive tree approach** combined with **LLM-based memoization**. This significantly increased the Zero Shot response accuracy for complex mortgage-related inquiries, boosting performance from **55 % to 80 % accuracy**.
